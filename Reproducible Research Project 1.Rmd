## Introduction
This is an R Markdown document that will be submitted for grading in the Coursera - Reproducible Research Project 1 provided by Johns Hopkins University.

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web site:

* Dataset: [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) [52K]

The variables included in this dataset are:

- **steps**: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as *NA*) </br>
- **date**: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format </br>
- **interval**: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken </br>

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.


## Loading Packages
```{r message=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(lubridate)
```


## Loading in Data
Download and unzip the file.
```{r}
url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(url, destfile = "activity.zip")
unzip("activity.zip")
```

Read the file
```{r}

activity <-read.csv("activity.csv")

```

Processing data
```{r}
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)
total_steps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, sum)
```

## Histogram of Steps by Date
```{r}
plot1 <- ggplot(total_steps, aes(x=steps)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "deepskyblue4", bins = 11) +
  labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Step Count", y = "Frequency")
print(plot1)
```


## Mean and median of steps by day
```{r}

mean(total_steps$steps, na.rm = T)
median(total_steps$steps, na.rm = T)

```


## Time Series plot of the average number of steps taken in a day.
Calculating the average steps taken for each 5-minute interval.
```{r}
interval_steps <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activity, mean)
```

Converting 'interval' column data to a vailid date-time format.
```{r}
interval_steps$time <- as.character(interval_steps$interval)

for (i in 1:2){
  interval_steps$time[i] <- as.character(paste0("0",interval_steps$time[i]))
}

for (i in 1:12){
  interval_steps$time[i] <- as.character(paste0("00",interval_steps$time[i]))
}

for (i in 13:120){
  interval_steps$time[i] <- as.character(paste0("0",interval_steps$time[i]))
}

interval_steps$time <- as.POSIXct(interval_steps$time, format = "%H%M")
```

Plot.
```{r}
plot2 <- ggplot(interval_steps, aes(x = time, y = steps)) +
  geom_line(col = "deepskyblue4") +
  labs(title = "Time Series Plot of Average Steps Taken", x = "Time of Day", y = "Steps") +
  scale_x_datetime(labels = date_format("%H:%M", tz = "MST"), date_breaks = "4 hours")
print(plot2)
```


## The 5-minute interval that on average contains the maximum number of steps
```{r}
interval_steps[which.max(interval_steps$steps),1:2]
```


## Imputing missing data
The total amount of NA's and the percentage of missing step data.
```{r}
nas <- is.na(activity$steps)
sum(nas)
mean(nas)
```

Function to impute the mean for a 5-minute interval into the appropriate mssing data (NA's).
```{r}
replaceNas= function(steps, interval) {
  replace = NA
  if (!is.na(steps)) { 
    replace = steps } 
  else {
    replace = interval_steps[interval_steps$interval == interval, "steps"]}
  return(replace) }
```

Apply 'replaceNas' function.
```{r}
filled_activity_data = activity
filled_activity_data$steps = mapply(replaceNas, filled_activity_data$steps, filled_activity_data$interval)
```


## Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values were imputed
```{r}
total_steps_filled <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = filled_activity_data, sum)
plot3 <- ggplot(total_steps_filled, aes(x = steps)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "deepskyblue4", bins = 11) + 
  labs(title = "Daily Steps with replaces NA's", x = "Step Count", y = "Frequency")

print(plot3)
```


## Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute intervals for Weekdays and Weekends
Creating two new factor variables showing the day of the week, and if its a weekday of weekend. 
```{r}
filled_activity_data$day <- weekdays(filled_activity_data$date)
weekday <- c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday")
weekDayOp <- function(dayofweek) {
  fill = ""
  if (dayofweek %in% weekday) {
    fill = "Weekday" }
  else {
    fill = "Weekend" }
  return(fill) }
filled_activity_data$weekday <- mapply(weekDayOp,filled_activity_data$day)
```

Calculating the average number of steps per 5-minute interval for weekdays and weekends.
```{r}
filled_totals_day <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + weekday, data = filled_activity_data, mean)
```



Coverting 'interval' column data to a vailid date-time format.

```{r}

filled_totals_day$time <- as.character(filled_totals_day$interval)

for (i in 1:2){

  filled_totals_day$time[i] <- as.character(paste0("0",filled_totals_day$time[i]))

}

for (i in 1:12){

  filled_totals_day$time[i] <- as.character(paste0("00",filled_totals_day$time[i]))

}

for (i in 13:120){

  filled_totals_day$time[i] <- as.character(paste0("0",filled_totals_day$time[i]))

}


filled_totals_day$time <- as.POSIXct(filled_totals_day$time, format = "%H%M")

```

Now that we have the valid date time format we can have a cleaner looking Time-Seriesplot, for comparison of the average 24-hour period on weekdays and weekends.
```{r}
plot4 <- ggplot(filled_totals_day, aes(time, steps, col = factor(weekday))) +
  facet_grid(.~factor(weekday)) +
  geom_line(show.legend = F) +
  labs(x = "Time of Day") +
  labs(y = "Steps") +
  labs(title = "Time Series Plot Comparison of Steps") +
  scale_x_datetime(labels = date_format("%H:%M", tz = "MST"), date_breaks = "6 hours")

print(plot4)
```
